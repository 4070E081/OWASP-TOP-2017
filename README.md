# OWASP-TOP-2017

## Introduction
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection
在網路應用程式中，Injection 弱點很常見，尤其在 SQL Injection。而 Injection 發生，通常是使用者提供的資料傳輸到interpreter， 被當成指令或是查詢。攻擊者就能用惡意的資料欺騙 interpreter，達到執行指令或竄改資料目的。

Threat Agents / Attack Vectors
Almost any source of data can be an injection vector, environment variables, parameters, external and internal web services, and all types of users. Injection flaws occur when an attacker can send hostile data to an interpreter.

Security Weakness
Injection can result in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, loss of accountability, or denial of access. Injection can sometimes lead to complete host takeover.
The business impact depends on the needs of the application and data.
